description: <p> <h3>What parents think</h3> </p> <br> <p>
<p> "Do it…. Worth every penny"</p>
 <br> Jon <br> July 2023. <br> <br>

<p> "Rachel is friendly and approachable, great communication and honest feedback, putting parents and their children at ease, at what can be a stressful time. Also has a good understanding that working with teenagers isn’t always easy, but remains calm and considerate of their individual needs, allowing them to talk honestly about their studies. If you are looking for a tutor, get in touch with Rachel, she will have a positive impact on your child." </p>
 <br> Hayley <br> Sept 2023 <br> <br>
<p> "Would wholeheartedly recommend your tutoring to anyone, and I’ll be engaging your services again for my son provided he does ok in his GCSE’s!</p>
 <br> Nicky <br> Sept 2023 <br> <br>
<p> "Go for it! If you just need that bit of extra support and honing of techniques, Rachel can work with you child to give them the confidence to go into that exam in a positive frame of mind. She’s flexible and can work on what you need." </p>
 <br> Becky <br> Aug 2023 <br> <br>
