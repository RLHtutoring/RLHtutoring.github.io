description: <p> I offer 1-1 bespoke online and face to face maths sessions for students from year 7 upwards. Online lessons use Microsoft Teams and a collaborative whiteboard so that students and I can work simultaneously. Face to face lessons are held at my home in a dedicated learning area where all my resources are to hand. </p> <p> In the first session, I focus on what the student’s goals are and then what their current needs are and any known gaps of knowledge. I can tutor maths in all stages of secondary education from Year 7 through to Year 13 as well as functional skills maths for adults. </p> <br> Early Secondary <br> <p> I work alongside multiple school schemes of learning by pre-teaching topics at the student’s own pace. They gain confidence in the key principles enabling more independent work in school, accessing more complex questions, and speeding up progress. We also focus on any lost prior learning in order to plug the gaps and develop core skills further. </p> <br> GCSE <br> <p> Students in their final year, for both Foundation and Higher, have a bespoke course delivered in two parts. First, we review all the key topics, complimented with topic specific exam questions, aimed at embedding key skills and developing understanding and application. The second part of the course focuses on exam technique and how to maximise marks by identifying the key skill being assessed in the question and analysing the mark scheme to better understand what the examiner is looking for. We continuously practise how to work through a question methodically and how to communicate our understanding in the best way. </p> <br> A level <br> <p> Students studying A level maths have individual sessions working through topics of their choosing to develop understanding and application, in particular by practising with targeted past exam questions. This can be in conjunction with school schemes of learning or independently. In Year 13 this is mainly done through past exam paper question practise. </p>
